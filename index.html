        <h5>Have You Ever Asked Yourself After A Bad Golf Shot "What Am I Doing Wrong?" <br />SwingShot Has The Answer! </h5>

        <p> Let's be honest. We all hit bad shots. The goal is to hit less of them. We know that's easy to say and hard to do. Every golfer develops bad habits that they're unaware of. If left unchecked, these habits become so deeply engrained they are difficult to correct. </p>
        <p>That's why touring pros are constantly working on their swing. Now you can too . . .</p>

            <p>Top golf teaching instructors universally acknowledge that video analysis is the most impactful innovation in the history of golf instruction.  Before video, golfers had to first understand, and then remember, the flaws their teacher saw in their swing. It's  one thing to hear my elbow is bent, but it's another thing to actually see how much it's bent and where  I'm bending it.  Seeing is believing. </p>
            <p>Before video, golf swing improvement was all "feel" and guesswork. How else can you fix something you  can't see?</p>

        <h3>Understand The Difference Between Your <br /> "Range Swing" And Your "Real Swing"</h3>
        <p>Some driving ranges now offer videotaping services.  Practice on the range is important for developing muscle memory, but most golfers who crush it on the driving range are frustrated to find they cannot repeat that performance out on the course. This is because the conditions on the driving range are totally different. Think about it . . .</p>
        <p>On the range you are:</p>
        <ul class="green-arrows bolder">
          <li>Hitting 20 balls in a row with the same club from a perfect lie; and</li>
          <li>There's no pressure to perform. If you hit a clunker, who cares?</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>Whereas on the course you have to:</p>
        <ul class="green-arrows bolder lighter">
          <li>Switch clubs on each shot;</li>
          <li>Hit from the rough, bunkers, and uneven lies; and</li> 
          <li>Deal with the pressure of scoring well. </li> 
        </ul>
        <p>If you want the maximum benefit from video, you should record and compare both your range swing your range swing. Fortunately, SwingShot makes it easy to record yourself on the range and on the course.</p> 
        <p>PGA Tour professionals have been recording and studying video footage of their practice rounds for more than a decade. For the rest of us, it's been impractical to hire someone to follow us for an entire round with a video camera.</p>
        <p>That is, until now...</p>

        <h3>The SwingShot Camera Changes Everything</h3>

        <div class="with-videoicon">

          <p>What if you could videotape your every shot, always at the perfect angle, without having someone else record you?</p>
          <p> Now, you can &mdash; with the SwingShot Golf Video Camera!</p>
          <p>The SwingShot camera was designed by golfers for golfers to make professional-grade video analysis available to everyone. Even PGA tour players think this is a great idea. We now have 18 PGA tour players using our camera in their practice rounds and on the range.</p>
          <p>Here Are A Few Key Features:</p>

          <p>Most people only think of video when they're trying to improve the mechanics of their golf swing. That's because it's never been practical to unobtrusively record yourself out on the course.  SwingShot cameras now make easy to record your favorite golf moments on beautiful courses. Imagine recording your approach to the majestic 7th green at Pebble Beach with waves crashing in the background or the hallowed 17th hole on the Old Course at St. Andrews.

          <h3>FAQ's</h3>
          <h5 class="faq-title">Will my SwingShot slow the pace of play?</h5>
          <p>Absolutely not! As golfers, we knew SwingShot could not slow play - at all - or else we wouldn't want to use it.  It only takes a couple seconds to stick it in the ground and press the button as you approach your ball.</p>
          <h5 class="faq-title">Will my SwingShot upset other golfers?</h5>
          <p>Only if they're jealous! Most golfer's who see SwingShot cameras ask "Where can I get one?"</p>
          <h5 class="faq-title">What good is the video from a SwingShot camera?</h5>
          <p>Besides showing off your eagle from last weekend . . . You can share video of your swing with your instructor so they can show you how to improve. You can also watch it yourself to prevent bad habits from taking root. </p>
          <h5 class="faq-title">Is there software out there that will analyze my swing for me?</h5>
          <p>Yes! Some of our favourites are Kinovea (free on PC) and Ubersense (free on tablets)</p>

            <cite>I'd been struggling with a recurring problem in my game that just wouldn't go away.  I talked to different teachers, tried all sorts of different grips, and just nothing worked.  It was making me crazy . . . that is, until I got a SwingShot camera!  It only took one swing&mdash;I'd never watched myself swing on the course before, and I instantly saw what I was doing wrong!  SwingShot saved me continued embarrassment and frustration!</cite>
